subtitle: Command-line interface for working with JavaScript and graphs
---

The Pika CLI is a command line tool that lets you:

- **easily call JavaScript from the shell**. You can invoke functions, pass arguments (including files or folder trees), and capture output as files. You can quickly experiment, test, or do ad hoc operations from the shell.
- **manipulate hierarchies, graphs, and other data** representable in the [Explorable](/core/explorable.html) graph interface — including data files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.

The hands-on [Intro to Pika CLI](intro.html) walks through common uses for pika.
