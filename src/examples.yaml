    The Web Origami documentation site itself has many features. The primary
    content is defined in markdown with inlined Origami expressions, allowing
    individual documentation pages to generate SVG diagrams and run code samples
    in order to incorporate their output. Various navigation elements like a
    sidebar and top navigation bar are generated from the structure of the
    content. The site also generates API documentation from JavaScript source
    files and includes a search feature that indexes all the content.
