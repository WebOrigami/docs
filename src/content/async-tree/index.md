The `async-tree` JavaScript library lets you work with different kinds of hierarchical data as a consistent type of abstract, asynchronous tree. This lets you create applications in plain JavaScript like those possible in the Origami [language](/language).

This library is an implementation of the async tree [pattern](/pattern/), providing definitions for asynchronous trees backed by standard JavaScript classes like `Object` and `Map` and standard browser APIs. The library also includes helper functions for common tree operations.

For an example of a site created with the `async-tree` library, see the [sample async-tree blog site](https://github.com/WebOrigami/pondlife-async-tree).
