${ templates/blocks.ori(areaLinks) }

The `async-tree` JavaScript library lets you work with different kinds of hierarchical data as a consistent type of abstract, asynchronous tree.

This library is an implementation of the async tree [pattern](/pattern/), providing definitions for asynchronous trees backed by standard JavaScript classes like `Object` and `Map` and standard browser APIs. The library also includes helper functions for common tree operations.
