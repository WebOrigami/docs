title: MapTree class
subtitle: Wraps a JavaScript Map instance as an async tree
---

Note: this class is used to turn a standard JavaScript [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) into an asynchronous tree. This is unrelated to this library's [`map`](map.html) function, which is used to map a tree's keys and/or values.
