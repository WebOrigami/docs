title: Start the CLI tutorial

This tutorial introduces the basics of ori. If you'd like to run the samples yourself, you can do that in two ways:

## Option 1: Web-hosted GitHub Codespaces coding environment

GitHub Codespaces is a web-based version of VS Code, a popular editor for professional software developers. Codespaces is a fee-based service, but free GitHub accounts include a monthly amount of free use of Codespaces.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open the
<a href="https://github.com/GraphOrigami/ori-intro" target="_blank">ori introduction on GitHub</a>.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Create your own copy of the project by clicking the **Fork** button near the top.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> In your newly-created copy of the framework intro project, click the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, then click the button **Create codespace on main**.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Install the Graph Origami command-line interface:

```console
$ npm install -g @graphorigami/origami
```

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Change to the `src` directory:

```console
$ cd src
```

## Option 2: Your local coding environment

With this option, you can use whatever code editor you prefer. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Clone the [GraphOrigami/ori-intro](https://github.com/GraphOrigami/ori-intro) repository to your own machine.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open a terminal window in the project's root directory.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Install the Graph Origami command-line interface:

```console
$ npm install -g @graphorigami/origami
```

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Change to the `src` directory:

```console
$ cd src
```
