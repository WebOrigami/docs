The Origami CLI, called `ori`, is a command line tool that lets you:

- **easily call JavaScript from the shell**. You can invoke functions, pass arguments (including files or folder trees), and capture output as files. You can quickly experiment, test, or do ad hoc operations from the shell.
- **manipulate hierarchies, trees, and other data** representable in the [async tree pattern](/pattern) — including data files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.

Follow the intro tutorial to walk through common uses for the Origami CLI. Alternatively, you can [install Origami](installing.html) and create a simple project.
