title: Operators
---

Origami is a dialect of JavaScript expressions so closely follows [JavaScript operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence).

## Operator precedence

Origami introduces some operators of its own, listed here alongside the standard JavaScript operators. Operators are listed in order from highest precedence to lowest precedence.

| Operator                                                    | Example                       | Associativity |

An operatorâ€™s precedence determines how the Origami parser handles expressions that have more than one possible interpretation.

Example: `a -> b => c` could be interpreted as `a -> (b => c)` or `(a -> b) => c`. Origami uses the former interpretation, because the arrow operator has a higher precedence than Origami pipe operator.

## Spaces required for certain operators

Note: Origami allows the characters `%`, `&`, `+`, `-`, and `^` in [references](syntax.html#references). To use those characters as operators, put spaces around the character.

For example, minus signs often appear in file names as hyphens, so:

```
package-lock.json
```

refers to a file called `package-lock.json`. If you really intended to perform subtraction, put spaces around the minus sign:

```
package - lock.json
```

would subtract the value of `lock.json` from the value of `package`.

Along the same lines, Origami uses the `/` to delineate keys in a path like `foo/bar`. If you want to use `/` to do division, you must put a space around it: `foo / bar`.
