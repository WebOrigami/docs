Returns true if the indicated object can be directly treated as an asynchronous tree.

See [treelike objects](/async-tree/treelike.html) for a list of types.

Note: the [`from`](from.html) method accepts any JavaScript object, but `isTreelike` returns `false` for an object that isn't one of the above types.
