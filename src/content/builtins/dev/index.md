title: Dev namespace
subtitle: Develop and debug Origami projects
---

The `Dev` namespace provides commands for developing with Origami. These commands are generally used in the [CLI](/cli) or build scripts.

When working in the CLI, all `Dev` commands are directly available as top-level globals to make them easier to type. Instead of having to type:

```console
$ ori Dev.serve
```

you can invoke the [serve](serve.html) command with

```console
$ ori serve
```

## Commands by name

${ commandList.jse/Dev }
