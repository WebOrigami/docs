Origami trees such as file system folders or sites will return values as raw data. Origami can implicitly [unpack such files](/language/fileTypes.html#unpacking-files) based on the file's extension.

In rare cases you may need to explicitly unpack file data, which you can do by passing it to the `unpack` function.
