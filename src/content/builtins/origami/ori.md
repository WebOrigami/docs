Evaluates the text input as an Origami expression and returns the result.

This function can occasionally be useful in the context of debugging an Origami site in the browser with the [`debug`](/builtins/dev/debug.html) tool. In the address bar, you can enter an Origami expression like

```
http://localhost:5000/!ori <expression>
```

to evaluate the expression and view its result in the browser.
