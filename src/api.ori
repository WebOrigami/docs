// The following formulas are used by specific pages that want to inline API
// documentation for specific classes in the async-tree library. The formula
// creates a virtual tree of API documentation objects for the async-tree
// library. That formula uses a custom transform called `jsApi`, based on the
// Microsoft TypeScript compiler, which parses JavaScript source to extract type
// information and comments.
