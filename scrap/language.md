Here’s a secret: _creating a site shouldn’t require complex tools_.

If you already know some HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, you already know most of what you need to build a site from scratch. All you need is:

- a Transform to Publish model for thinking about your site as a transformation of source content
- a language for describing that transformation
- a way to represent structured information as a [tree](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)>)
- a library of functions for common site tasks
