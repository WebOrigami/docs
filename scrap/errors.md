title: Errors
---

The Origami compiler and runtime attempt to provide meaningful error messages to help you debug problems.

The error messages should be self-explanatory, but this page summarizes some of them in order to characterize the type of messages you might see. This is done so that people can help identify _when an error message isn't good enough_.

If you encounter a confusing message that you feel could have been more helpful, please bring it to the attention of the project. There are, of course, limits on how helpful Origami can be, but it's extremely helpful to know where people get confused; if the underlying feature can't be made more usable, perhaps at least a better error message could be created.

## Sample messages

| Code            | Error message |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| `doesntExist()` |
