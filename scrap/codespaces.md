## Use the GitHub Codespaces editor

This option doesn't involve installing any software on your own machine.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open the
<a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami-intro" target="_blank">introduction on GitHub</a>.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Create your own copy of the project by clicking the **Fork** button near the top.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> In your newly-created copy of the pattern intro project, click the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, then click **Create codespace on main** or the `+` button.

A VS Code project editor will start. Eventually you'll see a list of files on the left.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Click the **Run and Debug** button (▷) in the left bar, then **▷ Launch via npm**. This will start the small Origami server.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> A notification should appear saying, "Your application running on port 5000 is available." Click the **Open in Browser** button to open the running tutorial site in a separate window tab.

You're going to be switching back and forth between these two browser windows. Let's call the first one the **Code** window and the new one the **Preview** window.

The page in the Preview window should say: Hello

You're now ready to [begin the tutorial](tutorial2.html).
