  Origami comics: You don't need plugins to define a feed for your blog; feed
  formats are comprehensible by design.

      Site generators typically create blog feeds via **plugins** that are often
      magic and hard to configure.

    footnote: Configuration **sounds** easy but can get complicated.

      Standard feed formats are actually comparatively simple! The **JSON Feed**
      format is just your blog posts as JSON data.
    scene: editor.ori.html
    name: feed.json
    content: !ori feed.json
    footnote: See jsonfeed.org

  - text: >
      You can write an **Origami expression** that translates your blog posts to
      an object with the JSON Feed fields.
    scene: editor.ori.html
    name: feed.ori
    content: !ori feed.ori

  - text: >
      So you can add a JSON Feed and a widely-accepted **RSS feed** to your
      blog without any plugins!
