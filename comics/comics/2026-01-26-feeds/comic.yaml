      Many site generators require blog feed **plugins** that are typically
      magic and often hard to configure.

      The actual feed formats are reasonably simple! For example, the **JSON
      Feed** format can directly represent your blog content.
    scene: editor.ori.html
    name: feed.json
    content: !ori feed.json
    footnote: For details, visit jsonfeed.org

      You can write an **Origami expression** outputs your blog posts in JSON
      Feed format.
    scene: editor.ori.html
    name: feed.ori
    content: !ori feed.ori

  - text: >
      You can add the JSON Feed format and **RSS format** to your blog without
      any plugins at all!
