`ori` is a command line interface (CLI) that lets you:

- **Easily call JavaScript from the shell**, including the [Origami dialect](/language) of JavaScript expressions. You can invoke functions, pass arguments (including files and folders), and capture output as files. You can quickly experiment, test, or do ad hoc operations from the shell.
- **Manipulate data** — including data files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.
- **Perform common site tasks** such as serving and building static files.

If you're familiar with the concept of a [Read-Eval-Print Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), the `ori` tool lets you use your terminal itself as a JavaScript REPL.

Follow the intro tutorial to walk through common uses for the `ori` CLI. You can also [install ori](installing.html) and create a simple project.
