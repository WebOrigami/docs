`ori` is a command line interface (CLI) that lets you:

- **Easily call JavaScript from the shell**. You can invoke functions, pass arguments (including files and folders), and capture output as files. You can quickly experiment, test, or do ad hoc operations from the shell.
- **Manipulate trees and other data** — including data files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.
- **Perform common site tasks** such as serving and building static files.

Follow the intro tutorial to walk through common uses for the `ori` CLI. You can also [install ori](installing.html) and create a simple project.
