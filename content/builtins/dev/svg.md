Returns a Scalable Vector Graphics [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) text describing a two-dimensional visual representation of the indicated tree, which can be any [treelike object](/async-tree/treelike.html).

In conjunction with [`debug`](debug.html), you can invoke `svg` from the browser address bar to visualize the tree at that point in the site:

```
http://localhost:5000/path/to/something/!svg
```
