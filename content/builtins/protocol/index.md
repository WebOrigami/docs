subtitle: Retrieve resources via URL protocols

The `Protocol` namespace groups the handlers for URL protocols (technically called "schemes") that can appear directly in Origami code. This grouping is primarily for documentation purposes; you will rarely need to invoke these protocols directly as functions.

## Commands by name
