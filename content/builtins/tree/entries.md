Returns a new iterator that yields a two-member array of `[key, value]` for each element in the [map-like](/async-tree/maplike.html) object. This is consistent with the numerous `entries()` methods in JavaScript, such as [Object.entries()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries).
