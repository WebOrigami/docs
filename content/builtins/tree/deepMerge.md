title: deepMerge(...trees)
supertitle: "Tree."

Similar to [`merge`](merge.html), but performs a deep merge of multiple [map-based trees](/async-tree/mapBasedTree.html). If more than one tree defines a value for the same key, and those values are themselves trees, then those values themselves will be merged.
