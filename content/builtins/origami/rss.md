Converts a tree of posts in [JSON Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/) format to [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) format. The `feed` can be any [map-like object](/async-tree/maplike.html).

This transformation is performed by the small [json-feed-to-rss](https://github.com/WebOrigami/json-feed-to-rss) library. JavaScript programmers can use that library to apply the transformation in regular JavaScript projects.
