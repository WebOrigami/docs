title: Origami expressions
subtitle: A dialect of JavaScript expressions
---

If you're familiar with JavaScript, Origami is essentially **JavaScript expressions plus paths**. It also includes minor adaptations that make it easier to define sites with expressions.

Origami language features are generally optional, but it does enforce one stylistic rule: you have to put spaces around operators like math operators.

## Quick reference

When evaluating Origami expressions on the command line, some additional [shell shorthand](/cli/shorthand.html) features are also available.

## Identifiers

As in JavaScript, an Origami identifier is a sequence of characters that can reference a local variable, global variable, function parameter. Additionally, in Origami an identifier can also refer to a local file or folder.

All valid JavaScript identifiers like `name` or `postal_code` are valid Origami identifiers — but to allow identifiers to more easily refer to files, Origami identifiers are more permissive than JavaScript's.

- Any character allowed in a JavaScript identifier, including characters like digits that are only allowed after the start, are allowed at any position in an Origami identifier. (Specifically, any character can be drawn from the the Unicode [ID_Continue](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#D1) class.)
- Origami identifiers can also include these anywhere: `.` `@` `~`
- Origami identifiers can include these after the first position: `!` `%` `&` `*` `+` `-` `^` `|`

Examples of identifiers which are not valid in JavaScript but which _are_ valid in Origami:

```
index.md
404.html
my-pictures
```

An identifier can appear on its own or as part of a [path](#paths).

A standalone sequence of digits and no other characters like `123` is treated as a [number](#numbers); if you need to reference a file or folder whose name is only digits, use [angle brackets](#angle-brackets): `<123>`. However, a sequence of digits in a [path](#path) is always treated as an identifier: the path `posts/2026` ends with the string identifier "2026", not the number 2026.

### Globals

Origami expressions can reference the full set of [standard JavaScript built-in objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects). Origami also adds its own globals:

- [`Dev`](/builtins/dev)
- [`Origami`](/builtins/origami)
- [`Protocol`](/builtins/protocol)
- [`Tree`](/builtins/tree)

### File name heuristic

The above definition of identifiers lets you directly include file names in Origami expressions:

```ori
Origami.mdHtml(ReadMe.md)
```

This expression passes the `ReadMe.md` file to Origami's builtin [`mdHtml`](/builtins/origami/mdHtml.html) function.

The period in `Origami.mdHtml` above is standard JavaScript syntax for property access, but the period in `ReadMe.md` is just a character in a file name. Origami distinguishes these cases using a heuristic.

To determine how to interpret a period in a sequence like `a.b.c`:

1. If there's a local variable whose entire name is `a.b.c`, Origami treats the complete name as a reference to that local variable.
1. Next Origami looks at the part before the first period: `a`. If that is the name of a local variable, Origami treats the `a` as a reference to that local variable, and the `.b` and `.c` as property access.
1. Origami then considers whether `a` is the name of a [global](#globals). If so, the `a` references that global variable and the `.b` and `.c` are property access.
1. Otherwise Origami treats the complete name `a.b.c` as a reference to a local file or folder that will be located using Origami [scope](scope.html).

In the above example of `Origami.mdHtml(ReadMe.md)`:

- `Origami` is a global, so `Origami.mdHtml` gets the `mdHtml` property of the global `Origami` object. The value of that is a builtin function.
- There is no global variable called `ReadMe`, and assuming there is no local variable with that name, Origami treats `ReadMe.md` as the name of a local file or folder.

Origami allows the JavaScript math symbols `+`, `-`, `*`, and `~` to appear in a name: e.g., `package-lock.json`. To invoke a binary operator, add spaces around it; see [Operators](#operators).

### Name conflicts

One reason the above heuristic generally works is that most JavaScript globals start with or contain uppercase letters, while development projects often use lowercase names for folder and file names. This reduces the chances for name collisions.

That said, the following lowercase JavaScript globals or keywords are available in Origami:

```
async
await
atob
bota
console
crypto
escape
eval
false
fetch
import
navigator
null
performance
process
true
typeof
undefined
unescape
void
```

If your project happens to have a folder or file that is one of these names, or has an initial section before the first `.` that is one of these names, you can surround the path with [angle brackets](#angle-brackets). Example: `performance.yaml` starts with `performance`; to avoid conflicting with the `performance` global, use angle brackets: `<performance.yaml>`.

Another potential source of name conflicts are file names that begin with the same name as a local:

```ori
{
  index.html = index.ori(posts.ori)
  posts/ = Tree.map(markdown/, postPage.ori)
}
```

Here the `posts.ori` reference won’t find the expected local file. Instead, it will match the local `posts/` variable; see [local property references](#local-property-references) below. Origami will then search that result for a non-existent `ori` property. To fix this, rename `posts.ori` or surround it with angle brackets: `<posts.ori>`.

Note that the following does not produce a conflict:

```ori
{
  posts/ = Tree.map(markdown/, posts.ori)
}
```

When defining an object key like `posts/` here, the expression that defines the value will never match the key being defined. (Otherwise this would create an infinite loop.) So `posts.ori` in this case can’t match the `posts/` local variable, and will find the file as expected.

## Paths

A sequence of [identifiers](#identifiers) separated with `/` slash characters is treated as a _path_.

```ori
package.json/name
```

In a path, the first part of the path (here, `package.json`) will _always_ be treated as a complete [identifier](#identifiers). If that name matches a local variable, then the path will be evaluated using that variable as the start. Otherwise Origami assumes the path starts with the name of a local file or folder.

- A path beginning with `~/` will be taken as a reference to the user's home directory.
- If you want to reference an absolute path that starts with a slash, use [angle brackets](#angle-brackets). This avoids conflict with JavaScript's regular expression syntax: `/etc/` is a regular expression, not a path.

### Angle brackets

You can explicitly define a path or URL by enclosing it in `< >` angle brackets:

```ori
<src/data.json>
```

The first part of the path (here, `src`) will be resolved using Origami [scope](scope.html); the rest of the path keys will be used to traverse the value to retrieve a final result.

Angle brackets are also useful if your path includes spaces or other characters that aren't valid in Origami identifiers:

```ori
<markdown/My File with Spaces (and Parens).md>
```

Inside the angle brackets you can use any character except a tab, newline, or `>`. If you need to include a `>` in a path, escape it with a `\\` backslash.

Although Origami can always recognize [URLs](#urls) that start with a protocol, you can also put a URL in angle brackets:

```ori
<https://example.com>
```

### Trailing slashes

Paths in Origami follow a [trailing slash convention](http://localhost:5000/async-tree/interface.html#trailing-slash-convention):

- If a trailing slash is present, then the value is definitely a traversable subtree.
- If a trailing slash is not present, the value may or may not be a subtree. That is, a tree isn’t obligated to append slashes to any or all of its keys for traversable subtrees.

In practice, when writing a path for a folder, you have the _option_ to end the path with a trailing slash. If your project includes a folder called "markdown", both of these paths will find the folder:

```
markdown
markdown/
```

You may find the latter form a helpful as a reminder that "markdown/" references a folder.

A trailing slash on a path to a file containing data [unpacks](fileTypes.html#unpacking-files) the file content into data; see below.

### Result of a path

A path to a file returns the raw contents of the indicated file.

- For a file name or path, this will be a [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array).
- For a URL, this will be an [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer).

Origami has built-in handlers that can parse the contents of common [file types](http://localhost:5000/language/fileTypes.html) such as JSON and markdown with front matter; see that page for details. This allows you to, for example, obtain your project's version number from its `package.json` file via:

```ori
(package.json).version
```

Or you can download a file and extract data from it:

```ori
(https://example.com/data.json).users[0].name
```

You can also use angle brackets for this:

```ori
<https://example.com/data.json>.users[0].name
```

If a file path ends in a trailing slash, Origami will [unpack](fileTypes.html#unpacking-files) the file content into data. For example, if `posts/post1.md` is a markdown file, the expression:

```ori
posts/post1.md
```

returns the file content as a `Uint8Array`. If you want to work with that as text, you can pass that to [`Origami.string`](/builtins/origami/string.html).

If, however, you want to work with that as a [document](documents.html) object, you can append a trailing slash:

```ori
posts/post1.md/
```

This returns the content of `post1.md` as an object, including any front matter data as properties.

Note that most Origami [builtin functions](/builtins) that expect a [treelike](/async-tree/treelike.html) argument will automatically unpack a file or resource (such as `Uint8Array` or `ArrayBuffer`) value as long as the path includes a known file extension.

## URLs

If a sequence starts with a scheme (protocol) and a colon, Origami treats it as a URL:

```
https://example.com
```

The only characters that cannot be used in a URL are whitespace or characters that end an expression: `,` `)`, `]`, `}`. If you need to incorporate such a character into a URL, escape it with a `\\` backslash. Alternatively, place the URL in [angle brackets](#angle-brackets).

## Numbers

Origami supports integers and floating point JavaScript [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) values.

Origami does not yet support binary, octal, hexadecimal numeric literals, nor does it support exponential notation. If necessary you can create such numbers with the JavaScript `Number()` function:

```ori
Number('0xf')     // ${ Number("0xf") }
Number('1e2')     // ${ Number("1e2") }
```

## Strings

Strings with double quotes and single quotes are essentially the same as in JavaScript:

```
'string'
"string"
```

You can escape characters with a `\\` backslash:

```
'It\\'s great'
```

### Templates

Text templates are quoted in backticks and can contain Origami expressions inside `\$\{` `}` placeholders. The evaluated expression results will be substituted for those placeholders in the template's text output.

Expressions inside an Origami template literal can directly return complex values like arrays, objects, or trees. Origami will perform a depth-first traversal of the result, await any `Promise` values, and concatenate the final values into the string result:

```
`Hello, \${ { name: 'Alice' } }.`      // "Hello, Alice."
```

This is different than JavaScript, where the above produces: `"Hello, [object Object]."`

Among other things, this means that a template can inline the text content a file by name:

```console
$ cat pet.txt
Jiji
$ cat bio.ori
\`I have a cat named \$\{ pet.txt }.`
$ ori bio.ori/
I have a cat named Jiji.
```

See [Templates](templates.html) for more about using templates to generate HTML and other text formats.

You can prefix a template literal with a function name immediately before the leading backtick. This invokes that function with the strings that make up the template's boilerplate text and a set of values to be substituted in the output — the same function signature as a JavaScript [tagged template function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates). See [`Tree.indent`](/builtins/tree/indent.html) for an example of a builtin function that you can use in a tagged template.

## Object literals

Origami's basic syntax for constructing object literals is essentially the same as JavaScript's: define an object literal with `{` and `}` curly braces surrounding key/value pairs:

```ori
{
  name: "Alice"
  location: "Honolulu"
}
```

You can separate key/value pairs with commas, newlines, or both.

Any valid Origami [identifier](#identifiers) can be used as an object key without being quoted. This means you can define a virtual file with a name like `index.html`:

```ori
{
  index.html: "Welcome to my site!"
}
```

To define a key that's not a valid identifier, such as one that includes spaces, put the key in single or double quotes:

```ori
{
  "Test File.txt": "Sample text"
}
```

### Shorthand properties

As a shorthand, you can define a property with just an [identifier](#identifiers):

```ori
{
  // Include the project's README.md file in this object
  README.md
}
```

This is shorthand for defining that key with a value that looks up that same key in the current scope:

```ori
{
  // Include the project's README.md file in this object
  README.md: README.md
}
```

This extends to defining a property with a path. The last part of the path becomes the key, so

```ori
{
  path/to/file.txt
}
```

is the same as

```ori
{
  file.txt: path/to/file.txt
}
```

You can also achieve the same result with angle brackets:

```ori
{
  <path/to/file.txt>
}
```

### Property getters

The value in a key/value pair will be evaluated once, when the object is loaded. The following object, for example, evaluates `createPage.js()` only once:

```ori
{
  index.html: createPage.js()
}
```

Origami lets you define property getters that will be evaluated each time the property is requested, using `=` equals signs instead of `:` colons:

```ori
{
  index.html = createPage.js()
}
```

Each time this object is asked for the value of `index.html`, Origami will invoke `createPage.js()` and return that result. The above is roughly equivalent to the following JavaScript syntax:

```js
/* JavaScript approximation of the above */
{
  get ["index.html"]() { return createPage(); }
}
```

### Property access

There are several ways to access the property of an object.

Suppose `alice.ori` contains:

```ori
// alice.ori
{
  name: "Alice"
  location: "Honolulu"
}
```

You can reference the "name" property of this file in several ways:

- `(alice.ori).name` — Put the `.name` reference after a closing parenthesis
- `alice.ori .name` — Put the `.name` reference after whitespace (this might look a little strange, but is standard JavaScript syntax)
- `alice.ori["name"]` — Use the string `"name"` in square brackets
- `alice.ori/name` — Origami treats any [treelike](/async-tree/treelike.html) object as a tree that can be traversed with [path](#paths) syntax
- `alice.ori("name")` — Origami allows any tree to be [called like a function](#trees-as-functions).

### Local property access

The expression that defines the value of a property can reference other properties in the same object, or any parent object, by name.

```ori
// localRef.ori
${ samples/help/localRef.ori }
```

This evaluates to:

```console
$ ori localRef.ori/
${ Origami.yaml(samples/help/localRef.ori/) }
```

This type of local property access is not possible in JavaScript without introducing a separate variable declaration:

```js
// JavaScript equivalent
const a = 1;
const obj = {
  a,
  b: a,
};
```

Origami will avoid recursive local references. If you try to define a `name` property whose value expression refers to `name`, Origami assumes the latter refers to an inherited `name` property.

```ori
// inherited.ori
${ samples/help/inherited.ori }
```

Here the expression `\${ name }` resolves to the inherited `name` defined in the parent object.

```console
$ ori inherited.ori
${ Origami.yaml(samples/help/inherited.ori/) }
```

### Non-enumerable properties

Object keys in parentheses like `(x)` are not [enumerable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties): they will not be included in a list of the object's keys. Such properties will generally not be included when the object is copied or displayed.

One use for non-enumerable properties is in calculating a value that will be used in more than one place.

```ori
// hidden.ori
${ samples/help/hidden.ori }
```

Here, the declaration of the `company` property is in parentheses, so it is non-enumerable. It can be referenced by other object properties, but will not be included in the object's keys. This means it won't be shown when the object is displayed:

```console
$ ori hidden.ori/
${ Origami.yaml(samples/help/hidden.ori/) }
```

Marking a property as non-enumerable only affects whether it is included in the object's list of keys; a non-enumerable property is still accessible if one knows the property name:

```console
$ ori hidden.ori/company
${ Origami.yaml(samples/help/hidden.ori/company) }
```

### Keys with trailing slashes

As noted above, paths can [end in trailing slashes](#trailing-slashes) to follow Origami's [trailing slash convention](http://localhost:5000/async-tree/interface.html#trailing-slash-convention).

When defining an object, you have the option of adding a trailing slash to a key whose value is a traversable subtree. This can be a useful way of reminding readers of the code (including yourself later) that the value is a tree.

For example, you might use the [`Tree.map`](/builtins/tree/map.html) builtin to convert a collection of markdown files to HTML:

```
// site.ori
${ samples/howTo/markdown/site.ori }
```

Here the trailing slash in `pages/` serves as a reminder that the property's value is a traversable tree of data. If someone asks for this object's keys, the key for `pages/` will include this trailing slash signal:

```console
$ ori keys site.ori
${ Origami.yaml(Tree.keys(samples/howTo/markdown/site.ori)) + "\n" }
```

### Object nesting

As in JavaScript, object literals can be nested. A common use for this in Origami is to define the overall structure of a website in a `.ori` file:

```
// subtree.ori
${ samples/help/subtree.ori }
```

When this file is served as a site, the user will be able to browse to `about/index.html`.

When an object created with an object literal is treated as a tree, any key whose value is another object literal implicitly ends in a trailing slash:

```console
$ ori Tree.keys subtree.ori
${ Origami.yaml(Tree.keys(samples/help/subtree.ori)) + "\n" }
```

Here the builtin [`Tree.keys`](/builtins/tree/keys.html) function shows a trailing slash on `about/` even though a trailing slash isn't explicitly included in the `subtree.ori` source code. However, if the object is unpacked and passed to the standard JavaScript [`Object.keys`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) method, the keys will be returned directly as defined:

```console
$ ori Object.keys subtree.ori/
${ Origami.yaml(Object.keys(samples/help/subtree.ori/)) + "\n" }
```

## Array literals

Origami arrays are essentially the same as JavaScript arrays, and are defined with `[` `]` square brackets:

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

As with [object literals](#object-literals), you can separate array items with commas, newlines, or both:

```
[
  1
  2
  3
]
```

## Function calls

Function calls in Origami look like those in JavaScript:

```ori
Math.max(1, 2)
```

You can call a function defined in a JavaScript file by referencing its file name and then invoking it with parentheses:

```ori
greet.js("Alice")
```

or with an explicit path in angle brackets:

```ori
<greet.js>("Alice")
```

Origami assumes that any function might be asynchronous, so implicitly uses `await` when calling all functions. For compatibility with JavaScript, Origami allows use of the `async` and `await` keywords, but these have no effect on the behavior of the code — they are always implied.

The Origami language runtime itself is written in JavaScript, so types such as numbers, strings, and objects are the same as in JavaScript. E.g., the above example passes an Origami string to a JavaScript function; inside that function, the supplied argument will be a regular JavaScript string.

Origami does not yet support `...` spreads in function calls.

### Trees as functions

Origami's [AsyncTree](/async-tree/interface.html) interface lets you treat a wide variety of [treelike](/async-tree/treelike.html) structures as hierarchical trees. You can use function syntax to obtain a value from the tree; this invokes the tree's `get` method.

This means you can use function call syntax to retrieve a value from a data structure, a folder, etc. If you have a data file:

```yaml
# capitals.yaml
${ samples/help/capitals.yaml }
```

you can extract a value from it with function syntax:

```console
$ ori "capitals.yaml('Spain')"
${ samples/help/capitals.yaml('Spain') + "\n" }
```

One use for this is to programmatically look up values: if a variable holds the name of a key, you can call the tree as a function and pass the variable as the argument.

### Functions as trees

Conversely, Origami lets you treat a function as a [treelike](/async-tree/treelike.html) object. This is true for arrow functions, Origami [builtin functions](/builtins), and functions exported by JavaScript modules.

This means you can traverse a function using [path](#paths) syntax, which can be convenient when using the Origami [CLI](/cli) to evaluate expressions in the shell. A shell will typically try to handle parentheses, and so disallow a function call with unquoted parentheses. But a shell will generally leave slashes untouched, allowing you to invoke a function and pass an argument.

```js
// uppercase.js
${ samples/cli/uppercase.js }
```

```console
$ ori uppercase.js/hello
${ samples/cli/uppercase.js/hello + "\n" }
```

## Arrow functions

An Origami expression can define a type of unnamed function called an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

You can define arrow functions using `=>` and any number of parameters:

```
(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, …) => expression
```

That `expression` will not be evaluated immediately, only later when the function is invoked.

For example, the [`Tree.map`](/builtins/tree/map.html) builtin function can apply another function to a tree's values and/or keys. To define a function that will be evaluated in the context of each tree value, you can use an arrow function:

```console
$ ori "Tree.map(['a', 'b', 'c'], (letter) => letter.toUpperCase())"
${ Origami.yaml(
  Tree.map(['a', 'b', 'c'], (letter) => letter.toUpperCase())
) }
```

Origami arrow function syntax does not yet support JavaScript's syntax for default parameters, rest parameters, or parameter destructuring.

## Operators

Origami closely follows [JavaScript operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence). Origami introduces some operators of its own, listed here alongside the standard JavaScript operators in order from highest to lowest precedence.

An operator’s precedence determines how the Origami parser handles expressions that have more than one possible interpretation.

Example: `a -> b => c` could be interpreted as `a -> (b => c)` or `(a -> b) => c`. Origami uses the former interpretation, because the arrow operator has a higher precedence than Origami's pipe operator.

Origami requires spaces around binary operators:

- `x + y`
- `x - y`
- `x * y`
- `x / y`

Without the spaces, Origami interprets `x/y` as a [path](#paths). Similarly, operators without surrounding spaces are treated as part of an [identifier](#identifiers): `package-lock.json` is an identifier, not a subtraction.

Spaces are not required around unary operators: `-foo` negates the value of `foo`. If you need to reference a local file that starts with a hyphen, put the name in [angle brackets](#angle-brackets): `<-foo>`.

Some addition usage notes:

- Instead of calling [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import), you can generally use a [path](#paths) instead.
- The `await` operator is implied in Origami so can always be omitted.

Origami does not yet support JavaScript's [optional chaining operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining): `x?.y`.

### Spread operator

You can use `...` three periods to merge arrays and objects.

```console
$ ori tree1.yaml
${ samples/help/merge/tree1.yaml }$ ori tree2.yaml
${ samples/help/merge/tree2.yaml }$ ori { ...tree1.yaml, ...tree2.yaml }
${ Origami.yaml({
  ...samples/help/merge/tree1.yaml
  ...samples/help/merge/tree2.yaml
}) }
```

As in JavaScript, the _last_ definition of a given key will be used. While both files above define a value for `c`, it's the second file whose value of `c` is used.

In an `.ori` file, you can use this to merge a folder into an object that also defines individual files.

```ori
{
  index.html: "Hello!"

  // Merge in everything in the `styles` folder
  ...styles
}
```

The spread operator performs a shallow merge. You can also perform a shallow merge with the built-in [`Tree.merge`](/builtins/tree/merge.html) function. For a deep merge, see [`Tree.deepMerge`](/builtins/tree/deepMerge.html).

### Pipe operator

Origami has a pipe operator `→` (which can also be written `->`) for representing a sequence of function calls. This can be used to avoid deep call nesting.

These deeply-nested function calls:

```ori
three(two(one(value)))
```

can be rewritten using the pipe operator:

```ori
value → one → two → three
```

This can be useful when applying multiple transformations of data. Suppose an index page is generated from markdown and then placed inside a template:

```ori
{
  index.html = template.ori(Origami.mdHtml(index.md))
}
```

You can rewrite the above using the pipe operator so that the flow of data reads proceeds from left to right:

```ori
{
  index.html = index.md → Origami.mdHtml → template.ori
}
```

This may make the flow of data easier to see.

The pipe operator passes the value from the left side of the operator to the function on the right side. If you need to provide additional arguments to that function, wrap the call in a [arrow function](#arrow-functions) that accepts a single argument and then calls your desired function with the additional arguments.

Example: these nested calls to [`Origami.mdHtml`](/builtins/origami/mdHtml.html) and [`Tree.sort`](/builtins/tree/sort.html) both take multiple arguments:

```ori
Tree.sort(Tree.map(markdown/, Origami.mdHtml), { compare: Origami.naturalOrder })
```

This can be rewritten with the pipe operator and arrow functions:

```ori
markdown/
→ (mdFiles) => Tree.map(mdFiles, Origami.mdHtml)
→ (htmlFiles) => Tree.sort(htmlFiles, { compare: Origami.naturalOrder })
```

## Grouping

You can group expressions with `(` `)` parentheses.

## Comments

Just like JavaScript, line comments start with `//` double slashes and extend to the end of the line:

```
// This is a line comment
```

One difference is that, in a [URL](#urls) or [path](#paths), Origami interprets consecutive double slashes as part of the path, _not_ a comment.

```
https://example.com/
path/with/consecutive//slashes
```

Those lines contain double slashes, but neither contains a comment.

Block comments are enclosed by `/* */`

```
/*
Block comment
*/
```

## Implied exports

Evaluating any Origami file with the `.ori` extension returns an evaluation of the file's top-level expression — unlike JavaScript, there is no need to explicitly `export` a value.

This `message.ori` file evaluates to a string:

```ori
// message.ori
"This file exports this message."
```

It is equivalent to this JavaScript:

```js
// message.js
export default "This file exports this message.";
```

## Shell shorthand syntax

To accommodate the use of Origami on the command line, the Origami [CLI](/cli) supports some additional [shorthand syntax](/cli/shorthand.html). The shorthands are not supported inside Origami `.ori` files.

## Unsupported JavaScript features

As an expression language, Origami does not include any of JavaScript's control structures like `for` or `while` loops. For the same reason, Origami doesn't support JavaScript operators that have side effects:

- Postfix and prefix operators `++`, `--`
- Assignment operators `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
- `delete` operator

Additionally, Origami does not currently support these features from JavaScript:

- binary, octal, hexadecimal numeric literals, or exponential notation (see [Numbers](#numbers))
- default parameters, rest parameters, parameter destructuring (see [Arrow functions](#arrow-functions))
- `...` spread operator in function calls
- `?.` optional chaining operator (see [Operators](#operators))
- defining an object key with a computed property
