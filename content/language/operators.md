title: Operators
---

Origami is a dialect of JavaScript expressions and closely follows [JavaScript operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence).

Origami introduces some operators of its own, listed here alongside the standard JavaScript operators. Operators are listed in order from highest precedence to lowest precedence.

| Operator                                                 | Example                       | Associativity |

An operatorâ€™s precedence determines how the Origami parser handles expressions that have more than one possible interpretation.

Example: `a -> b => c` could be interpreted as `a -> (b => c)` or `(a -> b) => c`. Origami uses the former interpretation, because the arrow operator has a higher precedence than Origami pipe operator.
