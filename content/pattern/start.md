title: Start the pattern tutorial
---

If you'd like to run the samples shown in this pattern tutorial, you can do that in two ways:

## Option 1: Web-hosted GitHub Codespaces coding environment

GitHub Codespaces is intended for people who are comfortable in a full programming environment. It uses a web-based version of VS Code, a popular editor for professional software developers. Codespaces is a fee-based service, but free GitHub accounts include a monthly amount of free use of Codespaces.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open the
<a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/pattern-intro" target="_blank">pattern introduction on GitHub</a>.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Create your own copy of the project by clicking the **Fork** button near the top.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> In your newly-created copy of the pattern intro project, click the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, then click the button **Create codespace on main**.

## Option 2: Your local coding environment

With this option, you can use whatever code editor you prefer. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Clone the [WebOrigami/pattern-intro](https://github.com/WebOrigami/pattern-intro) repository to your own machine.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open a terminal window in the project's root directory, then:

```console
$ npm install
```

This installs a single package you'll use in the tutorial to convert markdown content to HTML.
