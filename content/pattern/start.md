title: Start the pattern tutorial
---

If you'd like to run the samples shown in this pattern tutorial, you can use whatever coding environment you prefer. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Clone the [WebOrigami/pattern-intro](https://github.com/WebOrigami/pattern-intro) repository to your own machine.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open a terminal window in the project's root directory, then:

```console
$ npm install
```

This installs a single package you'll use in the tutorial to convert markdown content to HTML.
